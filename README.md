This is my submission for the stampix web assignment.

## Running the development build

`yarn start`

# Stampix Web Assignment

**Important**: You can choose any technology stack you want, this repo contains a scaffolded web app with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We will be evaluating the quality of your project, how you do it, is entirely up to you :)

## Goal

Create a triage screen for our website, where we separate consumer vs. business clients.
You can find the mockups on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/9OwDsbySKMVa78EKf4p9XS/Web-Assignment).

## Requirements
- The language buttons on top should update the copy. English should be in there, add at least one other language. We won't be evaluating the translation, of course
- The 2 buttons should redirect to, in order:
    1. https://stampix.com
    2. https://business.stampix.com
- The webpage should be made responsive. Seeing as the design is not complex, the mobile version can be a vertically stacked variant of the design
- Feel free to give your own twist to the page
    
## Testing
Language switching should be tested, anything else is optional. Quality over quantity!

## Evaluation
We will mainly check:
- The visuals of your implementation and how it relates to the mockup
- The quality of your code. Think best practices, cleanliness, readability, ...

## Delivery
Push your solution to your Git platform of choice, as long as it's public. Send us a link :)
